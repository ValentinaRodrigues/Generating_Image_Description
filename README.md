# Generating_Image_Description
## Semantic Description of Images
Developed a deep learning model in Python using Tensorflow, Numpy and Keras libraries to study the effect of LSTM layer in image captioning task. Used a pre-trained model involving convolutional neural network for extracting image features.
The model was trained to describe images in the form of sentences. The dataset used is Flickr 8K Dataset.
